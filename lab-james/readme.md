# Testing Controllers
This is the beginning of a CRUD app that uses Angular to create new Player or Monster objects based on user input from the webpage. It takes any custom name and follows with the user having to select other features for their player or monster.

# Installation
First, clone down the repo. Then, run `npm i` to install dependencies. Finally, you can `webpack` or `run npm watch` to create a build out of the assets provided in the `app` folder. The app will then be accessible via `build/index.html`.

# Testing
Testing will ensure a player and monster object are both created once the submit button is clicked. To run the test, type `karma start` in your command-line.
