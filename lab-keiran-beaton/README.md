# Lab 20 Testing Controllers

## Clone Down and install dependencies

use `npm i` in the command line to install the dependencies for the lab

## Run webpack-dev-server to create bundle.js

To run webpack-dev-server, type `npm run watch` in the terminal

## Running tests and linting files

To run tests, type `karma start` in the terminal

To run the linter, type `npm run lint` in the terminal

## using the app

To use the app, type `live-server` in the terminal. This will pull up the page. From there, simply fill out the fields with the requested information and press the submit button to create a player and a monster.

##BONUS POINT!!!!

I used ng-repeat in index.html to populate the select menu for choosing the player's class, and for choosing the monster's type
